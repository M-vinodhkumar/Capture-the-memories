📸 Camera Collection E-Commerce Website
🔧 Built with HTML | Tailwind CSS | JavaScript
📱 Fully Responsive | Modern UI | User-Friendly

🚀 I recently developed a fully responsive e-commerce website dedicated to showcasing and selling a wide range of camera products. The site is designed using clean HTML structure, styled with Tailwind CSS for rapid and scalable UI design, and powered by JavaScript for interactive features.

🔍 Key Features:
🛍️ Product Listing Page: Organized, filterable display of various camera models with ratings and pricing.

📄 Product Detail View: Dynamic sections for camera specs, large images, and smooth image zoom features.

🛒 Cart Functionality: Add to cart, quantity update, and total pricing logic handled via JavaScript.

🌙 Dark/Light Mode Toggle (optional).

📱 Fully Responsive: Optimized layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop using Tailwind’s grid & flex utilities.

⚡ Fast Load & SEO Friendly: Lightweight and structured for performance.

💡 This project helped me sharpen my frontend development skills, especially in building real-world user interfaces with a strong focus on user experience (UX) and mobile-first design principles.
